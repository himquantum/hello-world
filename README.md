# hello-world
THis is a new feature in 'branch' . i call it a sentence
some one will review this after my pull request and then it will merge in the master.

I proactively accomplished the automation of NFS server cleanup through the development of meticulously crafted purge scripts and their strategic execution, effectively clearing terabytes of storage. This proactive approach significantly mitigated server alerts due to space constraints.


Certainly! You can use a `case` function in Splunk to categorize events into three categories based on the `total_time` field. Here's a query for that:

```spl
index=your_index_name
| eval time_category=case(
    total_time < 7200, "Less than 2 hours",
    total_time >= 7200 AND total_time <= 14400, "Between 2 and 4 hours",
    total_time > 14400, "More than 4 hours",
    true(), "Unknown"  # Handle unexpected cases if any
)
| table event_name, time_category
```

This query creates a new field `time_category` using the `case` function to categorize events into "Less than 2 hours," "Between 2 and 4 hours," and "More than 4 hours." Adjust the index name accordingly.
Moreover, I demonstrated my research-oriented mindset by delving into Splunk logs from a variety of streaming apps. This research enabled me to create alerts for identifying errors, and I took the initiative to engage with various teams to thoroughly investigate these issues and collaboratively implement solutions.
